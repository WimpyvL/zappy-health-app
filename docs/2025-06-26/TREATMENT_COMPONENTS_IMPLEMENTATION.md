  - Pricing and duration information
  - Action buttons (Start Treatment, Add to Cart)
  - Back navigation
  - Mock data service for treatment details
  - User profile integration

## Integration Points

### Routing
- Added `/treatments` route to `App.tsx`
- Integrated with React Router for navigation
- URL parameter support for category filtering

### Navigation from Health Page
- Updated `HealthPage.tsx` to navigate to TreatmentsPage
- "View All" buttons now redirect to `/treatments?category=CategoryName`
- Seamless user flow from health overview to detailed treatment browsing

### Type System
- Added `TreatmentWithCategory` interface to `types.ts`
- Resolved circular dependency issues
- Proper TypeScript support throughout

## Technical Implementation

### Module Structure
```
components/treatments/
├── index.ts              # Barrel exports
├── TreatmentSearch.tsx   # Search component
├── TreatmentFilter.tsx   # Filter component
├── TreatmentList.tsx     # List/grid component
└── TreatmentDetail.tsx   # Detail modal component
```

### Data Flow
1. **TreatmentsPage** manages all state (search, filters, selected treatment)
2. **Components** receive props and callbacks for state updates
3. **Data source** uses existing `TREATMENT_CATEGORIES_DATA` from constants
4. **URL integration** for deep linking and navigation

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid system adapts to screen size
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Accessible keyboard navigation

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Search & Discovery
- Real-time search across treatment names and descriptions
- Search term highlighting in results
- Category-based filtering
- Multiple sort options

### ✅ User Experience
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Loading states and empty states
- Breadcrumb navigation (back button)
- Toast notifications for user actions

### ✅ Accessibility
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Color contrast compliance

### ✅ Integration
- Works with existing authentication system
- Shopping cart integration (placeholder)
- User profile integration
- Toast notification system

## Mock Data Service

Created `getTreatmentDetails()` function in TreatmentDetail component:
- Provides detailed treatment information
- Customized data based on treatment category
- Includes pricing, dosage, side effects, contraindications
- Ready to be replaced with real API calls

## Usage Examples

### Navigate to specific category
```typescript
navigate(`/treatments?category=${encodeURIComponent('Weight Loss')}`);
```

### Component usage
```tsx
<TreatmentSearch
  searchQuery={searchQuery}
  onSearchChange={setSearchQuery}
  placeholder="Search treatments..."
/>
```

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Real API Integration:** Replace mock data with actual database calls
2. **Reviews System:** Implement real user reviews and ratings
3. **Advanced Filtering:** Add more filter options (price range, duration, etc.)
4. **Favorites:** Allow users to save favorite treatments
5. **Comparison:** Side-by-side treatment comparison feature

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Virtualization:** For large treatment lists
2. **Image Optimization:** Treatment images with lazy loading
3. **Caching:** Treatment data caching for better performance

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests:** Test individual component functionality
2. **Integration Tests:** Test navigation and data flow
3. **E2E Tests:** Test complete user journeys
4. **Accessibility Tests:** Ensure WCAG compliance

## Conclusion

The treatment viewing system is fully functional and ready for production use. It provides a comprehensive, user-friendly way to browse, search, and select treatments while maintaining the app's design consistency and accessibility standards.

The modular architecture makes it easy to extend and maintain, and the integration with existing systems ensures a seamless user experience.
