- **Seamless Integration**: All new features accessible from existing navigation patterns

## Technical Architecture

### Database Design
```sql
-- Core tables for messaging
- conversations: Patient-doctor conversation metadata
- messages: Individual message content and metadata
- doctors: Healthcare provider profiles
- message_read_status: Read receipt tracking

-- Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Proper indexing for performance
- Automatic timestamp management
```

```sql
-- Run the messaging schema
\i supabase/messaging_schema.sql

-- Optionally add test data
\i scripts/test-messaging-data.sql
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Ensure your Supabase configuration in `lib/supabase.ts` includes:
- Correct project URL and anon key
- Real-time subscriptions enabled for messaging tables

### 3. Development Testing
- Start the development server: `npm run dev`
- Use the MessagingTestUtils component (bottom-right corner in dev mode)
- Test database connectivity and message sending
- Switch between different user perspectives for testing

## Real-Time Features
